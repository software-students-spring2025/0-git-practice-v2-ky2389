## Commentary 
Ever since its release, the quality and originality of DeepSeek has been questioned by many. Recently, I found that when answering, sometimes DeepSeek would demonstrate ChatGPT-like properties, such as mentioning obedience to OpenAI policies. This undoubtedly raises concerns about its true internal nature.
However, the article by Lee et al. suggests that many models on the market rely on distilled model data, which might explain this behavior in DeepSeek. It could be simply a manifestation of this industry-wide practice rather than a direct replication of OpenAIâ€™s models.
